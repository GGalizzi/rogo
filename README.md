## Preliminary description and overview of the game mechanics. Things could change significantly.

##Souls of the Fallen

###Game mechanics:

You posses a so called "soul pouch", given to you by a shaman, which can store the souls of fallen foes, there's many different kinds of souls, each with their unique characteristics and powers.

Souls can be used for different purposes:

**Going to different planes**, planes are the world of SotF; the universe of Endaria is divided in an  innumerable amount of planes, they are connected through the energy of souls, and for a living being to be able tro travel between them, he must harness the power of the souls and infuse them into special crystals, so called "soul crystals", for this reason. Crystals come in different kinds, much like souls, and depending on the souls you infuse into them, and the kind of shards used, it will determine the plane you are sent to, experimentation will all kinds of souls and shards will surely allow you to discover different patterns, so you can go to planes that you want to.
Complete crystals are a rare find, most crystal you'll get are the ones you'll have crafted from different crystal shards found all over the planes of Endaria, combining different kinds of shards will produce unique crystals, allowing room for much experimentation to find interesting combinations, though pure crystals (crystals that have never been broken, not made from shards) will be the most powerful and might lead you to very interesting - and possibly dangerous - places.

**Strengthening oneself**, gathered souls can be merged into yours, depending on the soul characteristics, you'll be able to empower different things about yourself, but beware, as mergin some souls could be more harmful than beneficial, negative energy stored in souls can be purged by shamans, but negative energy can be useful for other uses.

**Strengtening equipment**, socketed equipment can have soul crystals inserted into them, again, experimenting with different crystals having different souls in them, will surely be beneficial.

Removing crystals from equipment is an easy task, and any smith can do it.

Removing souls from crystals is also possible, but not much of an easy job, only expert shamans can do this.

Reverting souls merged into yours (used to strengthen yourself) can also be done, but only a master shaman can do it, as he has to carefully retrieve the soul energy of added souls, and your original soul energy must remain untouched, otherwise, most dangerous and unexpected things could happen.
